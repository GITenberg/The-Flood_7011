description: From influential French novelist Emile Zola, author of Germinal and Therese
  Raquin comes The Flood in a brand new translation, a collection of dark and surreal
  short stories. 'The Flood' and accompanying stories 'Blood' and 'Three Wars' address
  ideas of human fragility and the uncontrollable effect the power of nature can have
  on our lives. 'The Flood' centres around Louis Roubien. Now an old man, the head
  of a large family, his many years of hard work on the land have transformed him
  from a peasant farmer into a prosperous and satisfied freeholder, distributing his
  largesse among his relatives and the local community.
